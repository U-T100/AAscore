## Installation
To calculate the AAscore, a reaction prediction model (T5Chem) and rxnmapper are required. You can use AAscore_env.yml for setting up the environment, but if it doesn't work, please install the necessary libraries from the following link.

If installing these via pip, Python 3.7 is highly recommended.
